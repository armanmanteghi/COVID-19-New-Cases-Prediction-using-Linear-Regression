# COVID-19 New Cases Prediction

## Overview
This project implements a linear regression model to predict new COVID-19 cases based on the number of confirmed cases from the previous week. By analyzing the relationship between these two variables, we can gain insights into the spread of COVID-19 and help inform public health decisions.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

## Data Source
The dataset used for this analysis is obtained from a CSV file named `country_wise_latest.csv`, which contains the latest COVID-19 statistics by country.

## Getting Started
To run this project, you will need to have Python installed along with the required libraries. You can install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib
